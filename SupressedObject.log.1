Creo Simulation Live currently only supports Structural, Modal and Steady State
  Thermal analysis. All other analysis types are ignored.

Creo Simulation Live currently only recognizes Boundary Condition entities
  (Constraints and Loads) created in Creo Simulate.

All other simulation entities (Beams, Springs etc.) and properties (Mesh
  control, regions etc.) are ignored. All interfaces are considered bonded.

Creo Simulation Live currently does not recognize material assignment done in
  Creo Simulate. The material has to be assigned to the model in Creo design
  environment.

Loads :
